- pretty much a copy of "campaign" in ATS and ETS
- start off with small plane, like cessna and work your way up to 757
	- will need to decide how to deal with different planes
		- how much it costs to rent/buy
		- how to get the data, maybe there's a way to see power output or something
- have skills user can unlock/purchase
	- get better pay
	- more/better mission availablity
- have missions
	- will need to get nearby airports
		- hopefully there's a way to see what type of airport it is
			- big vs small
			- asphalt vs grass
		- more missions will go to bigger airport, maybe better pay
- user is rewarded for completing a mission
	- base price of mission
		- decided by distance probably
	- times any skill multipliers
	- minus any penalties from poor flying
		- banking too hard on turns
		- too high g's
		- anything else that would make a flight not feel smooth leads to penalties
		- maybe some missions don't matter as much
			- shipment of pillows don't care if you fly upside down
			- passengers care very much if you fly upside down
